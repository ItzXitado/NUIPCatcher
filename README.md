# NUIPC Catcher

A software made during a curricular internship at Policia Judiciária. The purpose of this Python script is to, through a rejex, use Computer vision alied to OCR to detect the NUIPC in a given paper process.

# What is a NUIPC

In Portugal, NUIPC stands for "Número Único de Inquérito ou Processo Cível". It is a unique reference number assigned to each criminal case by the judicial authorities. This number is used to track and manage the case throughout the judicial process, from the initial investigation to the final resolution.

The NUIPC is crucial for ensuring that all documents, decisions, and actions related to a particular case are properly organized and accessible, helping to maintain transparency and efficiency within the Portuguese legal system.

## Features

- Real time Detection
- Multi-thread
- Rejex Matching
- Hot key activation
- Usage with app running in the background


## APIs

It was used Google Vision API to process the OCR, and to get the image to OCR it was used OpenCV's API.
